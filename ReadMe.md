# PowerShell Bug Reproductions

A small repo to reproduce PowerShell bugs in.

## ‚ùì Why this exists

When I encounter PowerShell bugs, I want to create minimal scripts that can reproduce the issue.
This makes it easy to share reproduction steps/examples with the PowerShell team, allowing them to confirm and troubleshoot the issue.

## üêû Bugs

Below is the list of bugs that I have found and can be reproduced:

- [Windows PowerShell 5.1 - Get-ChildItem ignores -Depth when used with -Include](src/5.1/Get-ChildItemIgnoresDepthParameter/ReadMe.md)
- [Windows PowerShell 5.1 - Start-Transcript inverts Write-Information behavior](src/5.1/Start-TranscriptInvertsWrite-Information/ReadMe.md)

## üìÅ Repo organization

All code is located in the [src](/src/) folder.
The next folder indicates the version of PowerShell the bug should be reproducible in.
Lastly, each bug reproduction is put in it's own folder, along with a `ReadMe.md` file that describes it.
