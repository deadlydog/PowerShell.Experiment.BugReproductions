# PowerShell Bug Reproductions

A small repo to reproduce PowerShell bugs in.

## ❓ Why this exists

When I encounter PowerShell bugs, I want to create minimal scripts that can reproduce the issue.
This makes it easy to share reproduction steps/examples with the PowerShell team, allowing them to confirm and troubleshoot the issue.

## 📁 File organization

All code is located in the `src` folder.
The next folder indicates the version of PowerShell the bug should be reproducible in.
Lastly, each bug reproduction is put in it's own folder, along with a ReadMe.md file that describes it.

## ❤️ Donate to support this project
