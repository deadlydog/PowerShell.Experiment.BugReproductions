# PowerShell Bug Reproductions

A small repo to reproduce PowerShell bugs in.

## ‚ùì Why this exists

When I encounter PowerShell bugs, I want to create minimal scripts that can reproduce the issue.
This makes it easy to share reproduction steps/examples with the PowerShell team, allowing them to confirm and troubleshoot the issue.

## üìÅ File organization

Each bug reproduction is put in it's own folder, located within a folder indicating the version of PowerShell the bug should be reproducible in.
